    // Core algorithm content
    problemStatement: `Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.`,

    examples: [
      {
        input: "nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9",
        output: "[0,1]",
        explanation: "Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].",
      },
      {
        input: "nums = [3,2,4], target = 6",
        output: "[1,2]",
        explanation: "Because nums[1] + nums[2] == 6, we return [1, 2].",

      content: `Imagine you're organizing a dance competition where each dancer has a skill level (number), and you need to find pairs whose combined skill levels equal exactly 10 points.

**The Naive Approach (Brute Force):** You'd ask each dancer to try dancing with every other dancer until you find a perfect match. This is like checking every possible pair in the array - slow and inefficient!

**The Smart Approach (Hash Map):** Instead, you create a "compatibility board" where you write down what skill level each dancer needs in a partner. As each dancer arrives, you check the board - if someone already needs their exact skill level, you've found a match instantly!

This is exactly how the Two Sum algorithm works - the hash map is your "compatibility board" that remembers what numbers you're looking for.`,
